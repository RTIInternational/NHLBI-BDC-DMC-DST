# Introduction
This guide will provide instruction and information on setting up the development environment for the BioData Catalyst (BDC) Data Management Core (DMC) Data Submission Dashboard (DSD). This will include installing prerequisites, setting up a development environment, building the container, deploying to BioData Catalyst, running tests/linting, and information about contributing to development.

# Prerequisites
The DSD has a number of dependancies that are necessary both for building and deployment as well as for development. This section will describe how to install and set up each of these dependancies. The primary development environment is currently Ubntu 22.04 but other environments will be added as requested.
